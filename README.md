# Nannou templates

Since [nannou_new](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/tree/master/nannou_new) is broken for some time, this is a repository for generating [nannou](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou) projects via [cargo-generate](https://cargo-generate.github.io/cargo-generate/)

## Dependencies
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate)


Example:
```sh
$ cargo generate pavlus/nannou-templates
```

You will be prompted which template you want to use:
